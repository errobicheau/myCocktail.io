# myCocktail.io - Mixology at Your Fingertips
myCocktail.io is a powerful, lightweight front end application that empowers users to effortlessly search a diverse cocktail database, making it a go-to app for those seeking recipes or info on a variety of cocktails.

## How It's Made:

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)

myCocktail.io was built on the Node.js engine with the React.js framework for the front-end. Additionally, TailwindCSS was used for styling purposes. This app utilizes data from *The Cocktail DB*'s [open-source cocktail API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php). Other tools include Lodash for specific methods and Netlify for deployment.

## Optimizations & Roadmap

#### Optimizations
I consistently work to refactor my code with both readability and efficiency in mind. For mycocktail.io, I look to abstract the code further into a number of different components. This would make the code largely easier to maintain and debug, and would likely lead to performance increases.

#### Roadmap
As this is intended to be a lightweight and straight-forward front end application, it serves its basic (MVP) purpose quite well. However, the following improvements are scheduled to be added to expand on the app's basic functions and improve its cabaility substantially:
- Add ability to filter by properties (liquor type, glass type, drink tags)
- Add ability to search by ingredient(s)
- Add  ability to save ('favorite') drinks to a user profile.
- Refine overall search algorithm through additional packages or expansion to full-stack applciation.

## Lessons Learned:

myCocktail.io was a fantastic opportunity to take a deep dive into API usage. Utilizing a robust cocktail database, it has a large number of ways to read, extract, and display data to a user. This project challenged me to implement a flexible and attractive UI using React and TailwindCSS to display these results and quickly adapt to user input as it changes.
